## How to Run

### Anatomy

Our application has four moving parts:

1. React Client
2. Node + Express Server
3. Psql Database + Prisma ORM Layer
4. External API Data Dependencies

## Docker

We have now containerized the entire application with a single docker-compose.yml. This means that you will no longer need specified configurations for your server or client (No more .env necessary because it is in the compose).

1. Install Docker Desktop [Here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
2. Start the Docker Desktop. If the Daemon is running (pretty much as long as the app opens), you should be all good to proceed.

### Running the application with docker

1. Configure `.env` under `./seat-sleuth-server/.env`. This is because your local environment will be different than the stood up postgresql volume. Your `.env` should look like

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://seat-sleuth-user:seat-sleuth-password-12345@localhost:5432/seat-sleuth"
NODE_ENV="development"
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173"
SESSION_SECRET="<32 char secure string>"

```

**Note that** the database ul points to loclhost instead of database. This is because you will need manual database migrations if you want to run testing and or change code.

2. Change the permissions of the start script:

```bash
chmod +x ./start.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

You should see something like

```bash
